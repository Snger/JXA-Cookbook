The __System Events__ application lets you automate the GUI in any application. You can see some examples in [AppleScript Wikibook](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/AppleScript_Programming/System_Events).

```javascript
var se = Application('System Events')
```

Sending Keystrokes
------------------

```javascript
se.keystroke('Hello')
se.keystroke('a', { using: 'command down' })
```

Start the Screen Saver
----------------------

__AppleScript Equivalent:__ tell application "System Events" to start the current screen saver

However, the verb here is _start_, and the _current screen saver_ is the noun. So converting that to JavaScript-speak makes it look like this:

```javascript
se.start(se.currentScreenSaver)
```


Network: Connecting to a VPN or Other Network Service
-----------------------------------------------------

Assuming you have a VPN service called "MyVPN" in the network preferences. You can use JXA to tell your computer to connect to it.

__AppleScript Equivalent:__ tell application "System Events" to disconnect service "MyVPN" of network preferences

```javascript
se.connect(se.networkPreferences.services["MyVPN"])
```

Menu items
-------------------

### Security

First you must enable `osascript` access under *Security & Privacy* :arrow_right: *Accessibility* in *Settings*. The only way to do this is to use a front-end tool [`tccutil.py`](https://github.com/jacobsalmela/tccutil) to add the entry (since `osascript` is not a `.app` bundle).

Download the Python script and execute it like so:

```bash
sudo python tccutil.py -i /usr/bin/osascript
```

Note that you also must add any in-between applications, like `tmux` or `screen` if you expect osascript to work from there.

Also back in Settings, be sure to add *Terminal.app* which you can do normally.

## Clicking menu items

Understand that the top menu can only be grabbed with __System Events__ and you must activate the application for the menu you want before you can click the item. If you are doing GUI interactions, always think of the steps that you would take normally. Additionally, you may want to find the quickest way to do something, such as pressing a keyboard shortcut or clicking a menu item (instead of trying to position the cursor at an offset on the screen and clicking).

Activate the application first. Note that you should never treat these methods as blocking. You may want to add `delay()` in some cases.

```javascript
it = Application('iTunes');
it.activate();
```

You need to get the application via the System Events `processes` property. You can use the `byName()` on that collection for convenience.

```javascript
var its = se.processes.byName('iTunes');
```

Next, if security settings are set, we should be able to get the menu. Most applications will only have one `menuBar` however [some applications](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16497564/374110) will have more than one, such as a "tray icon". So while in AppleScript you would use `menu bar 1`, here you iterate from 0.

All menu bars contiain a `menuBarItems` property, which also has a `byName()` convenience method.

In `menuBarItems` you would find `Apple` (which is the Apple menu), an item with the name of the application, and the other menus after (if there are any).

```javascript
var fileMenu = proc.menuBars[0].menuBarItems.byName('File');
```

We can `.click()` this one but it will be so fast we probably will not see anything.

The structure of a menu contains further with `menuBarItem` objects containing a `menus` property. This may seem confusing as the name of it will refer to itself, but this is the actual equivalent to `NSMenu` in AppleScript. It will have the items we are looking for. Usually the first item is all we need.

```javascript
var editMenu = proc.menuBars[0].menuBarItems.byName('Edit');
editMenu.menus[0].menuItems.byName('Select All');
```

The structure of `.menuItems.byName()` to `.menus[0]` to `.menuItems.byName()` will continue as the menu has more children. If the name is dynamic, simply grab the menu items and use something like a regular expression:

```javascript
items = fileMenu.menus[0].menuItems(); // Note ()
for (var item, i = 0, j = items.length; i < j; i++) {
    item = items[i];
    if (item.enabled() &&
        /^Log out myname/.test(item.title()) { // again note () on attributes
        item.click();
    }
}
```

The major disadvantage to name matching is locale. Nothing here is locale-aware. If you need to support multiple languages, you may want to research into bridging with [`$.NSLocalizedStringFromTableInBundle()`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Miscellaneous/Foundation_Functions/index.html#//apple_ref/c/macro/NSLocalizedStringFromTableInBundle) or the [`NSLocale`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSLocale_Class/index.html) API.
